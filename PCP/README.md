# Initial Project Statement

## Objective
To create a three dimensional first person side scroller with FPS mechanics in the theme of Mario. The main idea being that after going through the same level a couple of times, the third time it would be different allowing Mario (the player) to pick up a weapon switching the camera from a side scrolling view to a first person view. The plot is still up in the air.

## Motivations
We both grew up playing Mario and are both avid fans of FPS games and thought it would be an interesting and challenging concept to combined the two.

## Languages
* C#
* Swift
* Facebook / Twitter post integration (Points, Time, etc)

## Technology
Indicate what technology you plan to explore/use:
 * Macintosh Laptop
 * Windows 7 Desktop / Windows 8 Laptop
 * Unity
 * Github

## Benefits
We will learn the basics of making an FPS game and how to work the game engine ‘Unity’. Additionally we would also learn 2 new programming languages (C# and Swift) which would be invaluable since we are going into the technology field.

## Foreseeable Challenges
* learning two new languages
* Creating a 3D world with working gravity and physics.
* Creating a working weapon and weapon effects on enemies.
* Making the game compatible on both Mac OSX & Windows 7/8

## High-Level Learning & Action Outline
 * Brainstorm application functionality - 1 Week
 * Learn C# and possibly Swift - 4 Weeks
 * Game Mock-Ups - 1 Week
 * Development - 6 Weeks
 * Testing and Fixing - 1 Week
 * Documentation - 1 Week
